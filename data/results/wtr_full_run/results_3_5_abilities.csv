[Submission]: As an AI language model, I do not have access to the latest updates and releases of card games. However, I can provide general information about the components of a card in Flesh and Blood.

In Flesh and Blood, each card has a class, card type, cost, pitch value, defence value, power value, and abilities. The class of a card determines which hero or class can use it. The card type can be an attack, defense, equipment, or action. The cost is the amount of resources required to play the card. The pitch value is the amount of resources the card can generate when played as a pitch. The defence value is the amount of damage the card can block when used as a defense reaction. The power value is the amount of damage the card can deal when used as an attack. The abilities are special effects that the card can trigger when played or used.

************
[Model Answer]: Disable (Blue) is a 'Guardian Action – Attack' card from the 'Welcome to Rathe' set. It costs 5, pitches for 3, defends for 3, has 7 power, and has the abilities; **Crush** - If Disable deals 4 or more damage to a hero, put a card from their arsenal on the bottom of its owner deck.

[Submission]: As an AI language model, I do not have access to the latest updates and releases of card games. However, I can provide general information about the structure of a Flesh and Blood card.

In Flesh and Blood, each card has a class, card type, cost, pitch value, defence value, power value, and abilities. The class determines which hero or class the card belongs to, while the card type indicates whether it is an attack, defense, or equipment card.

The cost is the amount of resources required to play the card, while the pitch value is the amount of resources that can be generated by pitching the card from hand. The defence value is the amount of damage that can be blocked by the card, while the power value is the amount of damage that can be dealt by the card.

Abilities are special effects that can be triggered by playing the card or fulfilling certain conditions.

************
[Submission]: Raging Onslaught (Red) is an attack action card in the game Flesh and Blood. It is a generic card, meaning it can be used by any hero class. The card has a cost of 2 resources and requires 1 red pitch to play.

When played, Raging Onslaught (Red) has a base power of 4 and a base defence of 0. However, it also has an ability that allows the player to boost its power by discarding a card from their hand. For each card discarded in this way, the power of Raging Onslaught (Red) is increased by 2.

This card is particularly useful for aggressive decks that want to deal a lot of damage quickly. By discarding multiple cards, players can increase the power of Raging Onslaught (Red) to deal significant damage to their opponent. However, this strategy does come at the cost of losing cards from their hand, which could limit their options in future turns.

The card's ability reads: ""If Emerging Power hits, the defending hero discards a card at random.""

This means that if the player successfully attacks with Emerging Power and deals damage to the opponent's hero, the opponent must then discard a card at random from their hand. This can be a powerful ability, as it can disrupt the opponent's strategy and limit their options for future turns.

Overall, Emerging Power (Red) is a useful card for any hero class that relies on attacking and dealing damage to the opponent. It can be particularly effective in decks that focus on discarding the opponent's cards or limiting their resources.

Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print only the single character ""Y"" or ""N"" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer.
At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.

2. The model answer states that the card has the ability ""Target weapon attack gains +3{p}"" and ""Reprise - If the defending hero has defended with a card from their hand this chain link, weapons you control gain +1{p} until end of turn.""

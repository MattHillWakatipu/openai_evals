Reasoning:","1. Model answer states that Anothos costs no resources to play.
2. Submission states that Anothos costs 6 resources to play.
3. The submission does not meet the criterion as the cost is not correct according to the model answer.

[BEGIN DATA]
************
[Question]: In the card game Flesh and Blood, what does the card Anothos do? Make sure to include information when appropriate for the class, card type, cost, pitch, defence, power, and any abilities.
************
[Model Answer]: Anothos is a 'Guardian Weapon – Hammer (2H)' card from the 'Welcome to Rathe' set. It has 4 power and the abilities; **Once per turn Action** - {r}{r}{r}: **Attack**

While there are 2 or more cards with cost 3 or greater in your pitch zone, Anothos has +2{p}.
************
[Submission]: Anothos is a legendary brute class card in Flesh and Blood. It costs 6 resources to play and has a pitch value of 3. It has a defence value of 1 and a power of 8.

Anothos has two abilities. The first ability is called ""Blood Debt."" When Anothos enters the arena, the player who played it takes 1 damage for each card in their hand. This damage cannot be prevented or reduced in any way.

The second ability is called ""Dominate."" If Anothos hits an opposing hero, the player who played it gains control of the defending hero's next action. This means that the player can choose what the defending hero does on their next turn.

Overall, Anothos is a powerful card that can deal a lot of damage and disrupt the opponent's strategy. However, the Blood Debt ability means that the player who plays it must be careful not to take too much damage themselves.

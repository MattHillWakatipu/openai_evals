The card has no defence value and no power value.\\n\\nThe ability of Underworld Dreams is as follows: \"At the beginning of your end phase, if Underworld Dreams is in your graveyard, you may banish it. If you do, each hero discards a card.\"\\n\\nThis ability allows the player to use the card multiple times if it is repeatedly put into the graveyard and then banished. The effect of forcing each hero to discard a card can be a powerful disruption tool, especially if used at the right time to disrupt the opponent\\'s strategy.\\n\\nOverall, Underworld Dreams is a useful card for Shadow decks that want to disrupt their opponent\\'s hand and gain an advantage in the game.'"

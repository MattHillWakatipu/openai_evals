    You are assessing the correctness of a submitted answer on a given task based on a criterion and a model answer. Here is the data:
    
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ************
    [Question]: {input}
    ************
    [Model Answer]: {ideal}
    ************
    [Submission]: {completion}
    ************
    [Criterion]: {criteria}
    ************
    [END DATA]
    
    Does the submission meet the criterion? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct.
    Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer.
    At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.

    Reasoning:
  choice_scores:
    "Y": 1.0
    "N": 0.0
  choice_strings: 'YN'
  args:
    criteria:
      set: "set: Is the set correct?"
      class: "class: Is the class correct?"
      type: "type: Is the card type correct?"
      cost: "cost: Is the cost correct?"
      pitch: "pitch: Is the pitch value correct?"
      defence: "defence: Is the defence value correct?"
      ability: "ability: Is the ability correct?"
